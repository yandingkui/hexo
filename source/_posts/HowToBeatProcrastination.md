拖延：一种找不出明显缘由却能毁灭你生活的行为。

Let me start by saying that I’ve had just about enough of the irony of battling through crippling procrastination while trying to write posts on procrastination and how to beat it. I’ve spent the last two weeks being this guy, who shoots himself in the foot while talking about gun safety, and I look forward to getting back to irony-free procrastination following this post.
首先，我想说的是，我已经受够了在写关于拖延症和如何克服拖延症的文章的同时，还要与拖延症作斗争的讽刺。我在这两个星期里面一直是一个贼喊捉贼的人，但是我也希望能通过这篇文章让我不在拖延。

A couple notes before we begin:  
开头我要申明两点：

- I’m not a professional at any of this, just a lifelong procrastinator who thinks about this topic all the time. I’m still in a total battle with my own habits, but I have made some progress in the last few years, and I’m drawing my thoughts from what’s worked for me.  
我并不是研究拖延症方面的专家，而是一个总在思考这个问题的长期拖延症患者。我依然长期在和我的拖延症斗争，但是在过去几年我已经取得了一些进步，我将从那些对我奏效的方法中总结一些我的想法。

- This post was posted late, not only because it took me 2,000 years to do, but also because I decided that Monday night was an urgent time to open Google Earth, hover a few hundred feet above the southern tip of India, and scroll all the way up India to the top of the country, to “get a better feel for India.” I have problems.
这个帖子发布迟了，不仅仅是因为我花费了太长的时间在上面，而且在紧急的星期一晚上，我打开了谷歌地图，把鼠标悬浮在印度的南端几百英尺的地方，然后向上滚动到到这个国家的上面，让我能“好好感受一下印度”。没错，我有拖延症。
